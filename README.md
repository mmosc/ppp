# Petrol Price Prediction
This tutorial is meant to be an introduction on how to use [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) for forecasting.

The tutorial is a follow-up of the project `Peep-peep-peep` developed by Larisa Manciu, Ariona Mahmutaj, ??? ???, and Marta Moscati for the first [Female Coders Hackathon](https://www.meetup.com/female-coders-linz/events/286136444/).

Many thanks to the mentors - Magdalena Radinger in particular - for their support in developing the project!
